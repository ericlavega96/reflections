When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you want that other people from the network can access to that content .
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if you are working in your local repository, and git makes pull automatically , the changes that I made in my local repository will be eliminated
